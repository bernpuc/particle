# particle
## Weather Station prototype
Based on Raspberry Pi

Controls a PMS5003 particle sensor and a SHT40 humidity and temperature sensor

Plans included adding an Arduino-based implementation. But the NodeMCU boards which are WiFi enabled might not have the I/O pins necessary to connect all the sensors. TBD
